# 🗒️ Lecture notes

[David Mermin's lecture notes](http://www.lassp.cornell.edu/mermin/qcomp/CS483.html) are introductory with a computer science focus

[QuantumAlgorithms.org](https://quantumalgorithms.org/) is a set of lecture notes for students in quantum algorithms and quantum machine learning. The scope is to bridge the gap between introductory material in quantum computing and research-grade papers, standardize notation, and to provide an overview on the state of algorithms for quantum machine learning and information processing.
