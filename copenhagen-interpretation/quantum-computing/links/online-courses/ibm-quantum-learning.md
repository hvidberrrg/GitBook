The [catalog of courses](https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/catalog/courses) include:

## Basics of quantum information

[_Basics of Quantum Information_](https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/course/basics-of-quantum-information) is the first unit of the [_Understanding Quantum Information and Computation_](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOFEBzvs-VvqKKMXX4vbi4EB1uaErFMSO) series, which explains quantum information and computation at a detailed mathematical level.

_Basics of Quantum Information_ begins with a mathematical description of quantum information for both single and multiple systems, then moves on to quantum circuits, and finally covers three fundamentally important examples — quantum teleportation, superdense coding, and the CHSH game — all of which are connected to the phenomenon of entanglement.

The series includes both written content and videos featuring John Watrous.\


## Fundamentals of quantum algorithms

[_Fundamentals of quantum algorithms_](https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/course/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms) is the second unit of the [_Understanding quantum information and computation_](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOFEBzvs-VvqKKMXX4vbi4EB1uaErFMSO) series.

This unit, _Fundamentals of quantum algorithms_, explores computational advantages of quantum information, including what we can do with quantum computers and their advantages over classical computers. The unit begins with quantum query algorithms, which offer simple proof of concept demonstrations for quantum algorithms, and then moves on to quantum algorithms for problems including integer factorization and unstructured search.
