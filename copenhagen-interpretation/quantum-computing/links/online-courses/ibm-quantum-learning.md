The [catalog of courses](https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/catalog/courses) include:

## Basics of quantum information

[_Basics of Quantum Information_](https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/course/basics-of-quantum-information) is the first unit of the _Understanding Quantum Information and Computation_ series, which explains quantum information and computation at a detailed mathematical level.

_Basics of Quantum Information_ begins with a mathematical description of quantum information for both single and multiple systems, then moves on to quantum circuits, and finally covers three fundamentally important examples — quantum teleportation, superdense coding, and the CHSH game — all of which are connected to the phenomenon of entanglement.

The series includes both written content and videos featuring John Watrous.
