# Azure Quantum

## Azure Quantum Katas

The [Azure Quantum Katas](https://quantum.microsoft.com/en-us/experience/quantum-katas) are self-paced learning tutorials. They focus on teaching quantum computing concepts and quantum programming using the Q# language, and include relevant theory and supporting interactive exercises designed to test knowledge.

A good place to start your quantum computing journey.

## Quantum computing foundations

â€‹[Quantum computing foundations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/quantum-computing-fundamentals/) is an Azure learning path that helps you start exploring quantum computing. Microsoft says that after completing this learning path, you'll be able to:

* Explain the fundamental concepts of quantum computing.
* Identify the kinds of problems quantum algorithms can solve more efficiently than classical algorithms.
* Build basic quantum programs by using the Quantum Development Kit and Q#.
* Interact with the Azure Quantum cloud service.
* Adapt and create Q# applications to run them on actual hardware.
* Estimate physical resources for quantum algorithms using Azure Quantum
