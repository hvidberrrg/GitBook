# MIT Open Learning Library

MIT offers two online courses on quantum information science, each course divided into three parts. Both are intermediate, graduate-level courses, and you must expect to put some effort into learning the material on your own. The course instructors are Isaac Chuang and Peter Shor.

The description below is taken from MIT.

## Quantum Information Science I

A three-course-module series that provides an introduction to the theory and practice of quantum computation. We cover:

* The physics of information processing
* Quantum logic gates
* Quantum algorithms including Shor's factoring algorithm and Grover's search algorithm
* Quantum error correction
* Quantum communication and key distribution

This course module will help you establish a foundation of knowledge for understanding what quantum computers can do, how they work, and how you can contribute to discovering new things and solving problems in quantum information science and engineering.

Prior knowledge of quantum mechanics is helpful but not required. It is best if you know some linear algebra.

The three-course-module series comprises:

### [8.370.1x - Quantum Information Science I, Part 1](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+8.370.1x+1T2018/course/)

Foundations of quantum and classical computing – quantum mechanics, reversible computation, and quantum measurement

### [8.370.2x - Quantum Information Science I, Part 2](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+8.370.2x+1T2018/course/)

Simple quantum protocols and algorithms – teleportation and superdense coding, the Deutsch-Jozsa and Simon's algorithm, Grover's quantum search algorithm, and Shor's quantum factoring algorithm

### [8.370.3x - Quantum Information Science I, Part 3](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+8.370.3x+1T2018/course/)

Foundations of quantum communication – noise and quantum channels, and quantum key distribution

## Quantum Information Science II

A three-course-module series that addresses advanced topics in quantum computation and quantum information, including:

* quantum error correction code techniques
* efficient quantum computation principles, including fault-tolerance
* quantum complexity theory and quantum information theory

This course module will help you advance to the frontier of knowledge in the field, in preparation for discovering new things and solving problems in quantum information science and engineering.

Prior knowledge of quantum circuits and elementary quantum algorithms is assumed. A working understanding of quantum mechanics and familiarity with linear algebra is strongly recommended.

The three-course-module series comprises:

### [8.371.1x - Quantum Information Science II, Part 1](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+8.371.1x+2T2018/course/)

Quantum states, noise and error correction

### [8.371.2x - Quantum Information Science II, Part 2](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+8.371.2x+2T2018/course/)

Efficient quantum computing - fault tolerance and complexity

### [8.371.3x - Quantum Information Science II, Part 3](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+8.371.3x+2T2018/course/)

Advanced quantum algorithms and information theory
